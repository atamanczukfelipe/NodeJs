# NodeJs

Simple NodeJs examples that try to cover most of used things and data structures over javascript.

- Modules
- File Manipulation
- HTTP
- events (with EventEmitter)
- NPM Package Manager
- External Package
- Sync/Assync Events
- Typescript Introduction


Obs:

```javascript 
npm install typescript --D
```
This is for Typescript installation with just Developer Dependency (--D)

```javascript 
npm install @types/node
```
This is for node types on ts, install this on the root directory
